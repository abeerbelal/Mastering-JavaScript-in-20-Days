## Coding Exercises for 3 challenges 🔥💻🚀
1. [Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-multiplication)

   My Solution💻:
```
let a = 25;
let b = 36;
let c = 46;

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
console.log(a,b,c);

```

2. [Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-the-plus-equals-operator)

      My Solution💻:
```
let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr +="This is the second sentence.";

console.log(myStr);

```

3. [Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string)

      My Solution💻:
```
const lastName = "Lovelace";

const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];

console.log(secondToLastLetterOfLastName);

```

4. [qustions about what is the output and why](https://github.com/orjwan-alrajaby/gsg-QA-Nablus-training-2023/blob/main/learning-sprint-1/week1%20-%20javascript-from-first-steps-to-professional/day%202/tasks.md)
   

  My Solution💻 1:
  ```
let a = 0;
let b = "0";
let c = false;
let d = "false";

console.log(a == b); // the output => true, because  the == operator for comparison, type coercion can occur.
console.log(b === c);// the output => false, because the === operator performs a strict equality comparison without type coercio
console.log(!!d);// the output => true, because (double negation) operator is used to convert a value to its boolean representation
```

  My Solution💻 2:
  ```
  console.log(4 + 5 * "7"); the output =>39

```
5 * "7" evaluates to 35 because the string "7" is coerced to the number 7.
4 + 35 evaluates to 39

  My Solution💻 3:
  ```
let result = 5 + 2 * 3 - 1;the output =>10 
```
JavaScript follows a specific order of operations, (*) has higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). So, the multiplication operation is performed first.then addition then subtraction.

  My Solution💻 4:
  ```
let x = 10;
let y = '10';
console.log(x == y); Output: true,
console.log(x === y);Output: false,
```
The == operator performs type coercion before making the comparison.
The === operator performs a strict equality comparison without type coercion.
variable x has the value 10 (a number), and the variable y has the value '10' (a string).

 My Solution💻 5:
 ```
let num = "15";
let isPositive = true;
let result = (num > 10 && isPositive) || num < 0;
console.log(result); //true
```
 The expression num > 10 compares the value of num with 10. Since num is a string ("15"), JavaScript will perform a lexicographic (string) comparison.Both operands are true, so the logical AND operation results in true.The string "15" is not lexicographically less than the number 0, so this comparison is false.One operand is true, so the logical OR operation results in true.
