## Coding Exercises for 3 challenges 🔥💻🚀
1. [Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-multiplication)

   My Solution💻:
```
let a = 25;
let b = 36;
let c = 46;

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
console.log(a,b,c);

```

2. [Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-the-plus-equals-operator)

      My Solution💻:
```
let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr +="This is the second sentence.";

console.log(myStr);

```

3. [Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string)

      My Solution💻:

4. [qustions about what is the output and why](https://github.com/orjwan-alrajaby/gsg-QA-Nablus-training-2023/blob/main/learning-sprint-1/week1%20-%20javascript-from-first-steps-to-professional/day%202/tasks.md)

  My Solution💻 1:
  ```
let a = 0;
let b = "0";
let c = false;
let d = "false";

console.log(a == b); // the output => true, because  
console.log(b === c);// the output => false, because 
console.log(!!d);// the output => true, because 
```

  My Solution💻 2:
  ```
  console.log(4 + 5 * "7"); the output =>39

```
