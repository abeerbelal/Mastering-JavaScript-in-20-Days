## Data Fetching & Promises 🎯✨🎀

**APIs** "applications programming interface" provide URLs that point at data we care about
```javaScript
https://dog.ceo/api/breed/hound/list
  {
    "message": [
      "afghan",
      "basset",
      "blood",
      "english",
      "ibizan",
      "plott",
      "walker"
    ],
    "status": "success"
  }
```
**fetch()** lets us use JS to load data from APIs ` fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breed/hound/list")`
>  ### JSON 📎🧷
> is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.
>  It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications
