## JavaScript Principles  ðŸŽ¯ðŸš€ 
When JavaScript code runs, it:

1. Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/ â€™executesâ€™ each line - known as the **thread of execution**
2. Saves â€˜dataâ€™ like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its memory. We can even save code (â€˜functionsâ€™)
